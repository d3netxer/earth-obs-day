<p>
The inaugural HOT Summit will bring together people from around the world working to make open geographic data available to improve the welfare of people living in vulnerable and disaster prone areas using OpenStreetMap as a foundation.
</p>
<p>Volunteer mappers, educators, community builders, humanitarians, geographers, and programmers will gather for a 3 day multi-track event to learn, discuss and share ideas about the humanitarian and economic development uses of OpenStreetMap.
</p>
<p>
Tracks will focus on technology and development, governance and partnerships, and education, capacity and community building. Sessions will be a mix of workshops, presentations, lighting talks and roundtable discussions, with plenty of space and time for meeting fellow HOT community members, hacking, talking and collaboration.
