This MapGive event is being held in the form of an internal staff training session for the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center. This event is being conducted in preparation for two larger MapGive events planned by RhodeIsland View for August 2015 (for the University of Rhode Island Scientific Support of Environmental Emergency Response (SSEER) (SSEER) team) and September 2015 (for the general public) at the University of Rhode Island.
