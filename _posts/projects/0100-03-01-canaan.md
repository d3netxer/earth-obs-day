description: In 2010, a magnitude 7 earthquake struck Port-au-Prince, Haiti, destroying hundreds of thousands of buildings and displacing 2.3 million people. 50,000 of these individuals resettled in Canaan, on the northern outskirts of Port-au-Prince. Canaan has not been formally recognized by the government and lacks running water, electricity, paved roads, and other services. We're mapping the area as part of a risk reduction and urban planning effort.
